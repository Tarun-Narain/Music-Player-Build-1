Music Player Build 1:

Please Dont get scared if you get a 'App Stopped Working'
as i was not able to test app for all SDKs.

It contains the basic player features:
1. Playing music
2. Automatically adding music from Directories
3. SeekBar Functionality
4. Play/Pause ImageButton
5. MaterialSearch(Bar only Search Function for next build)
6. RecyclerView(Basic Items only Title Functional)

	I haven't Tested the App Much Because of Slow Internet Connections

Issues and Bugs (Current)
1. Doesn't Works With Lower API(23 or Lower)
